---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Each of the 2 folders contain 4 .png images.

The 4 small images are 128x128 and each one is under 50kb they have that pixel look which corrsponds with Minetest.<br>
The 4 LARGE images are 768x768 and each one is under under 1mb.

To use the different textures after downloading you only need to open the "LARGE" folder and select all 4 images and replace the small ones in the texture folder in the MT_Village_Set MOD. Just select the "small" folder images if you want to revert back.

This and all other files will be updated as and when the time is right. Please be patient while everything is under construction. Thank you.
